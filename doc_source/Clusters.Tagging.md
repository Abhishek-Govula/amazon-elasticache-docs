# Monitoring a Cluster's Costs<a name="Clusters.Tagging"></a>

Cost allocation tags are key\-value pairs that you can use to track and manage your AWS costs by grouping expenses on your invoices by the tag values on a resource\.

You can use cost allocation tags to organize your AWS bill to reflect your own cost structure\. To do this, sign up to get your AWS account bill with tag key values included\. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values\. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across one or more services\.

For more information on Cost Allocation tags and steps to add or remove them from a cluster, see [Monitoring Costs with Cost Allocation Tags](Tagging.md)\.
