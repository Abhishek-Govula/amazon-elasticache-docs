# Creating a Redis Cluster with Replicas<a name="Replication.CreatingRepGroup"></a>

You have the following options for creating a cluster with replica nodes\. Which you use depends on whether you already have an available Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) cluster not associated with any cluster that has replicas to use as the primary node, or you need to create the primary node in with the cluster, and read replicas\. Currently, a Redis \(cluster mode enabled\) cluster must be created from scratch\.

**Option 1: [Creating a Cluster with Replicas Using an Available Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) Cluster](Replication.CreatingReplGroup.ExistingCluster.md)**  
Use this option to leverage an existing single\-node Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) cluster\. You will specify this existing cluster as the primary node in the new cluster, and then individually add 1 to 5 read replica to the cluster\. If the existing cluster is active, read replicas synchronize with it as they are created\. See [Creating a Cluster with Replicas Using an Available Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) Cluster](Replication.CreatingReplGroup.ExistingCluster.md)\.  
You cannot create a Redis \(cluster mode enabled\) cluster using an existing cluster\. To create a Redis \(cluster mode enabled\) cluster \(API/CLI: replication group\) using the ElastiCache console, see [Creating a Redis \(cluster mode enabled\) Cluster \(Console\)](Clusters.Create.CON.RedisCluster.md)\.

**Option 2: [Creating a Redis Cluster with Replicas from Scratch](Replication.CreatingReplGroup.NoExistingCluster.md)**  
Use this option if you don't already have an available Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) cluster to use as the cluster's primary, or if you want to create a Redis \(cluster mode enabled\) cluster\.  See [Creating a Redis Cluster with Replicas from Scratch](Replication.CreatingReplGroup.NoExistingCluster.md)\.
