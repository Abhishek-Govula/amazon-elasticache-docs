## Introductory Video Tutorials<a name="WhatIs.Videos.Beginning"></a>

The following videos introduce you to Amazon ElastiCache\.

### DAT204—Building Scalable Applications on AWS NoSQL Services \(re:Invent 2015\)<a name="WhatIs.Videos.Beginning.2015.DAT204"></a>

In this session, we discuss the benefits of NoSQL databases and take a tour of the main NoSQL services offered by AWS—Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon ElastiCache\. Then, we hear from two leading customers, Expedia and Mapbox, about their use cases and architectural challenges, and how they addressed them using AWS NoSQL services, including design patterns and best practices\. You will come out of this session having a better understanding of NoSQL and its powerful capabilities, ready to tackle your database challenges with confidence\.

### DAT207—Accelerating Application Performance with Amazon ElastiCache \(AWS re:Invent 2013\)<a name="WhatIs.Videos.Beginning.2013.DAT207"></a>

In this tutorial, learn how you can use Amazon ElastiCache to easily deploy a Memcached\- or Redis\-compatible in\-memory caching system to speed up your application performance\. We show you how to use Amazon ElastiCache to improve your application latency and reduce the load on your database servers\. We'll also show you how to build a caching layer that is easy to manage and scale as your application grows\. During this session, we go over various scenarios and use cases that can benefit by enabling caching, and discuss the features provided by Amazon ElastiCache\.

### DAT317—How IFTTT uses ElastiCache for Redis to Predict Events \(re:Invent 2016\)<a name="WhatIs.Videos.Advanced.2016.DAT317"></a>

IFTTT is a free service that empowers people to do more with the services they love, from automating simple tasks to transforming how someone interacts with and controls their home\. IFTTT uses ElastiCache for Redis to store transaction run history and schedule predictions as well as indexes for log documents on Amazon S3\. View this session to learn how the scripting power of Lua and the data types of Redis allowed people to accomplish something they wouldn't have been able to elsewhere\.
