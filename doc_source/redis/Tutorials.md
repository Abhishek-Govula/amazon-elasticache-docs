#### Supercharge your real\-time apps with Amazon ElastiCache \(re:Invent 2019\)<a name="WhatIs.Videos.Advanced.2019.DAT305"></a>

With the rapid growth in cloud adoption and the new scenarios that it empowers, applications need microsecond latency and high throughput to support millions of requests per second\. Developers have traditionally relied on specialized hardware and workarounds, such as disk\-based databases combined with data reduction techniques, to manage data for real\-time applications\. These approaches can be expensive and not scalable\. Learn how you can boost the performance of real\-time applications by using the fully managed, in\-memory Amazon ElastiCache for extreme performance, high scalability, availability, and security\.

#### Best practices: migrating Redis clusters from Amazon EC2 to ElastiCache \(re:Invent 2019\)<a name="WhatIs.Videos.Advanced.2019.DAT358"></a>

Managing Redis clusters on your own can be hard\. You have to provision hardware, patch software, back up data, and monitor workloads constantly\. With the newly released Online Migration feature for Amazon ElastiCache, you can now easily move your data from self\-hosted Redis on Amazon EC2 to fully managed Amazon ElastiCache, with cluster mode disabled\. In this session, you learn about the new Online Migration tool, see a demo, and, more importantly, learn hands\-on best practices for a smooth migration to Amazon ElastiCache\.
