# Tagging backups<a name="backups-tagging"></a>

You can assign your own metadata to each backup in the form of tags\. Tags enable you to categorize your backups in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment\. This is useful when you have many resources of the same typeâ€”you can quickly identify a specific resource based on the tags that you've assigned to it\. For more information, see [Resources you can tag](Tagging-Resources.md#Tagging-your-resources)\.

Cost allocation tags are a means of tracking your costs across multiple AWS services by grouping your expenses on invoices by tag values\. To learn more about cost allocation tags, see [Use cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html)\.

Using the ElastiCache console, the AWS CLI, or ElastiCache API you can add, list, modify, remove, or copy cost allocation tags on your backups\. For more information, see [Monitoring costs with cost allocation tags](Tagging.md)\.
