# Tagging backups<a name="backups-tagging"></a>

Cost allocation tags are a means of tracking your costs across multiple AWS services by grouping your expenses on invoices by tag values\. To learn more about cost allocation tags, see [Use cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html)\.

Using the ElastiCache console, the AWS CLI, or ElastiCache API you can add, list, modify, remove, or copy cost allocation tags on your backups\. For more information, see [Monitoring costs with cost allocation tags](Tagging.md)\.
