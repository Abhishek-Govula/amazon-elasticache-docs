# Connecting to a Cluster or Replication Group Running in an Amazon VPC<a name="VPCs.Connecting"></a>

This example shows how to launch an Amazon EC2 instance in your Amazon VPC\. You can then log in to this instance and access the ElastiCache cluster that is running in the Amazon VPC\.

**Note**  
For information about using Amazon EC2, see the [Amazon EC2 Getting Started Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/) in the [Amazon EC2 documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ec2/)\.

**Important**  
To avoid incurring additional charges on your AWS account, be sure to delete any AWS resources you no longer want after trying these examples\.

For information on connecting to your cluster, see [Connect to a Cluster's Node](GettingStarted.ConnectToCacheNode.md) in the ElastiCache User Guide\.
