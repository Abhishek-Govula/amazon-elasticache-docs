# Step 1: Create a cluster<a name="GettingStarted.CreateCluster"></a>

The cluster you create will be live, and not running in a sandbox\. You will incur the standard ElastiCache usage fees for the instance until you delete it\. The total charges will be minimal \(typically less than a dollar\) if you complete the exercise described here in one sitting and delete your cluster when you are finished\. For more information about ElastiCache usage rates, see [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/)\.

**Important**  
Your cluster is launched in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\) based on the Amazon VPC service\. Before you create your cluster, make sure that you create a subnet group\. For more information, see [Creating a subnet group](SubnetGroups.Creating.md)\.
