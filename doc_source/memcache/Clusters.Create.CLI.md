# Creating a cluster \(AWS CLI\)<a name="Clusters.Create.CLI"></a>

To create a cluster using the AWS CLI, use the `create-cache-cluster` command\.

**Important**  
As soon as your cluster becomes available, you're billed for each hour or partial hour that the cluster is active, even if you're not actively using it\. To stop incurring charges for this cluster, you must delete it\. See [Deleting a cluster](Clusters.Delete.md)\.
