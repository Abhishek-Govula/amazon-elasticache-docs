# Creating a cluster \(ElastiCache API\)<a name="Clusters.Create.API"></a>

To create a cluster using the ElastiCache API, use the `CreateCacheCluster` action\. 

**Important**  
As soon as your cluster becomes available, you're billed for each hour or partial hour that the cluster is active, even if you're not using it\. To stop incurring charges for this cluster, you must delete it\. See [Deleting a cluster](Clusters.Delete.md)\.
