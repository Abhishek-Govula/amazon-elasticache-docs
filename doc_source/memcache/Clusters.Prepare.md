# Preparing a cluster<a name="Clusters.Prepare"></a>

Following, you can find instructions on creating a cluster using the ElastiCache console, the AWS CLI, or the ElastiCache API\.

You can also create an ElastiCache cluster using [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)\. For more information, see [AWS::ElastiCache::CacheCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-elasticache-cache-cluster.html) in the *AWS Cloud Formation User Guide*, which includes guidance on how to implement that approach\.

Whenever you create a cluster , it is a good idea to do some preparatory work so you won't need to upgrade or make changes right away\.
